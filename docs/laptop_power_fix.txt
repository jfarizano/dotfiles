First check if support is already enabled with
lscpu | grep cppc

if you get no output then to 2

Make sure CPPC is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI, some its on by default others its not.

Most non-Epyc systems will need to add one or both of these to your kernel command line

Enable shared mem mode (This is not Required for Ryzen 7000 series+ and most laptop 5000/6000 series)

amd_pstate.shared_mem=1

EDIT: amd-pstate=passive is now required for kernels 6.1+

Pstate driver doesnt load automatically you can do this to load it on boot
by creating a file

/etc/modules-load.d/amd-pstate.conf

in that file it should say

# Load amd pstate at boot
amd_pstate
confirming its working you can do

install linux-tools-generic and run sudo cpupower frequency-info

fari@elissir:~$ sudo cpupower frequency-info
analyzing CPU 10:
  driver: amd-pstate
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 10
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 10
  maximum transition latency: 20.0 us
  hardware limits: 400 MHz - 4.46 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil
  current policy: frequency should be within 400 MHz and 4.46 GHz.
                  The governor "schedutil" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 2.54 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
    AMD PSTATE Highest Performance: 166. Maximum Frequency: 4.46 GHz.
    AMD PSTATE Nominal Performance: 119. Nominal Frequency: 3.20 GHz.
    AMD PSTATE Lowest Non-linear Performance: 41. Lowest Non-linear Frequency: 1.10 GHz.
    AMD PSTATE Lowest Performance: 15. Lowest Frequency: 400 MHz.

Didn't find the reason, but removing built-in gnome power-profiles and installing tlp did the job better:

sudo systemctl mask power-profiles-daemon.service
sudo apt purge --auto-remove power-profiles-daemon

tlp:
sudo apt install tlp
sudo systemctl enable tlp.service
reboot
